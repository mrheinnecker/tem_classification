## move to directory where scripts are in
cd /g/schwab/marco/repos/tem_classification/MainLine/Classifying


## from here scripts need to be executed from within python (maybe ill change this)
## if i want to use the pretrained parameters from gregoire, i can simply go for the 
## pretrained script from gregoire and use the pretrained labelled data to predict the cluster of new organelles


## if i want to retrain my clusters (but then i also have to redo the manual labelling)
## there is the knn_new.py script.... which i havent really tested for now

python3
